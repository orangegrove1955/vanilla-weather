# Vanilla Weather

A simple vanilla Javascript application for locating the user, and displaying the weather in their local area. This project pulls data from the Dark Sky API, and allows the user to show the temperature in both Celcius and Farenheit. If the user's location cannot be found, the project will alert the user that to that fact, then default to use New York weather.
